# What is this?

This is repository of all the dotfiles I use across different
boxes. Having a uniform work environment feels very cosy.

The configs have been tailored for Mac OS X, though they would
probably work fine on Linux too, maybe with a bit of tweaking.

Improvement suggestions are always welcome!
